# TODO: Add 5-10 more posts and labels.
#
# Requirements:
#   - For every new post you add to SAMPLE_POSTS, you must add one
#     matching label to TRUE_LABELS.
#   - SAMPLE_POSTS and TRUE_LABELS must always have the same length.
#   - Include a variety of language styles, such as:
#       * Slang ("lowkey", "highkey", "no cap")
#       * Emojis (":)", ":(", "🥲", "😂", "💀")
#       * Sarcasm ("I absolutely love getting stuck in traffic")
#       * Ambiguous or mixed feelings
#
# Tips:
#   - Try to create some examples that are hard to label even for you.
#   - Make a note of any examples that you and a friend might disagree on.
#     Those "edge cases" are interesting to inspect for both the rule based
#     and ML models.
#
# Example of how you might extend the lists:
#
# SAMPLE_POSTS.append("Lowkey stressed but kind of proud of myself")
# TRUE_LABELS.append("mixed")
#
# Remember to keep them aligned:
#   len(SAMPLE_POSTS) == len(TRUE_LABELS)
